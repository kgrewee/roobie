# Roobie

A minimalistic approach to web development.  Roobie makes web development **easier**.  Centralized CSS, JavaScript, themes, animations & more. Reuse core CSS classes and JavaScript functions instead of writing custom code.  Always build from a template.

Result
- Increased maintainability 
- Increased development speed
- Reduced custom code
- Reduced code cleanup
