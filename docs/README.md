# Roobie

A minimalistic approach to web development in Pure CSS and Vanilla JS.  Collection of CSS themes & utilities, JavaScript functions, animations and more.  Reduce boilerplate code with a lightweight and easy to use API.   Reuse core CSS classes and JavaScript functions instead of writing custom code.  Always build from a template.

## Benefits

**No external dependencies**<br>
Roobie will always be Pure CSS and Vanilla JS.

**Reduce custom code**<br>
Reusing CSS and JS results is less custom written code for each project.

**Increase maintainability**<br>
Reducing custom code results in less code that needs to be maintained.

**Increase development speed**<br>
Start your project from a template with toolkit and multiple themes.

**Reduce code cleanup**<br>
When HTML content gets deleted, you don't have to clean up the CSS and JS.
