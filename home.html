        <h3>Centralized Styles</h3>
        <p>
            More content, less redundant styles. Roobie focuses on centralizing styles in pre-defined CSS classes to reduce code and improve development speed. Build full websites solely with Roobie CSS. Change the variables and use it as a main stylesheet or plugin
            for your Web application.
        </p>
        <h3>Components</h3>
        <p>
            We offer a variety of pre-built components styled with our CSS classes. Check them out and use them as building blocks.
