## Syntax

We basically have our own mini-language to simplify naming and reduce code.  Here's the basics.

### Naming

Class names are prefixed pertaining to their function

- div - Container
- ht - Height
- scr - Scroll
- flx - Flex
- flt - Float
- mrg - Margin
- op - Opacity
- btn - Button
- txt - Text
- wrp - Wrap
- aln - Align
- jst - Justify
- spc - Space
- bg - Background
- inp - Input
- br - Border Radius
- out - Outline
- in - Inset
- ord - Order
- ul - Unordered list
- ol - Ordered list

### Sizing

When a class needs to have different sizes, we use this convention. 

- xs - Extra small
- s - Small
- m - Medium
- l - Large
- xl - Extra large

Some classes, such as txt, offer more extreme sizes.
