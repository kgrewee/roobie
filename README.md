Writing the same CSS over and over again increases file sizes and load times.  Centralize common web patterns and build from them.  Use our CSS variables to inherit and change themes within minutes.  Build an entire website without leaving your HTML.  Reduce boilerplate code with a lightweight and easy to use API.   Reuse core CSS classes and JavaScript functions instead of writing custom code.  Always build from a template.
