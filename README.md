# 💎 Roobie

Website code is often sloppy and inefficient.  All developers have different code patterns and naming conventions when making CSS classes and JavaScript functions.  Common CSS properties are often repeated on multiple classes and applied to a single element, creating duplicate code and slower load times.  Roobie aims to centralize common web patterns and naming conventions to help a teams efficiently code together.  Roobie favors reusing CSS classes and JavaScript functions, making HTML files bigger, but reducing custom written CSS and JavaScript code.

**Benefits**

- Increased maintainability 
- Increased development speed
- Reduced custom code
- Reduced code cleanup
